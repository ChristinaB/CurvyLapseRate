Code for analysis of elevation distributed micro-climatology data in a coastal glaciated watershed.

Air temperatures and relative humidity were collected on a longitudinal transect in the North Fork Nooksack River Watershed in Whatcom County, Washington. This code is useful for assessment of observations, especially lapse rates with increasing elevation and microclimatic influences.  Every hydrologic model that we know of (circa 2019) uses a linear annual lapse rate (e.g. -6.5 C/km clear sky assumption; - 4.5 C/km North Cascades Mountain Range) to represent the change in temperature with elevation.  We are collecting empirical evidence to test the hypothesis that high elevation temperature lapse rates in glaciated mountain peaks, especially in maritime climates, are linear.  They may be curvy.

Curvy is something to be proud of. -Paloma Faith
