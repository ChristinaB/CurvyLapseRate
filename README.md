Code for analysis of elevation distributed micro-climatology data in a coastal glaciated watershed.

Air temperatures and relative humidity were collected on a longitudinal transect in the North Fork Nooksack River Watershed in Whatcom County, Washington. This code is useful for assessment of observations, especially lapse rates with increasing elevation and microclimatic influences.
